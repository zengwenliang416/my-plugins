    "rationale": "Trae SOLO Coder is a standalone AI IDE without public integration APIs. While the multi-agent concepts are similar to ccg-workflows (Plan Mode ~ TPD, parallel agents ~ Task tool), there is no documented way to invoke Trae agents from external systems. The recommended path is to: (1) enhance ccg-workflows' existing multi-agent capabilities, or (2) wait for ByteDance to release official Trae APIs. Direct integration attempts would be high-risk and potentially violate ToS."
