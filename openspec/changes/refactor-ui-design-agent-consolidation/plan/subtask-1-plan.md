# Subtask 1 Plan

## Objective
Design consolidated agent model and command routing updates.

## Inputs
- Existing UI-design command and agent files
- Existing artifact contract

## Outputs
- Final merge mapping and routing parameters (`mode`, `perspective`)

## Execution Steps
1. Map old agents to consolidated roles.
2. Define role-specific outputs and communication expectations.
3. Validate that all old output artifacts remain covered.

## Risks
- Missing one old path during mapping.

## Verification
- Mapping covers all old agent responsibilities.
