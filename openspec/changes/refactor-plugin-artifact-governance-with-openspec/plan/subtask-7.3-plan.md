# Subtask Plan: 7.3 (migration completion summary)

## Meta

- Subtask ID: 7.3
- Target file: `openspec/changes/refactor-plugin-artifact-governance-with-openspec/plan/migration-summary.md`
- Goal: Finalize migration summary with completion status, validations, and handoff notes.
- Date: 2026-02-11

## Objective

Produce a final completion summary that includes:
1. migrated files/workstreams;
2. validation outcomes;
3. residual risks and next actions for review handoff.

## Inputs

- Current migration summary draft
- Completed task checklist and validation command outputs

## Outputs

- Finalized migration summary document ready for handoff.

## Execution Steps

1. Switch status from in-progress to completed.
2. Replace stale "Next" items with final handoff notes.
3. Add validation snapshot (`openspec validate`, grep checks, cleanup status).
4. Keep concise completed-subtask log for auditability.

## Risks

- Summary drift if it does not match current task checklist state.
- Missing validation evidence would weaken handoff confidence.

## Verification

- Summary explicitly reports completion state and latest validation results.
- Content aligns with `tasks.md` checked items.

## Done Criteria

- 7.3 marked complete with up-to-date migration summary.
